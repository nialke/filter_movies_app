A simple application with specific movies filtering. 

Includes three functions:
1) Returns 3 random titles.
2) Returns all movies starting with the letter 'W' but only if they have an even number of characters in the title.
3) Returns all titles that consist of more than 1 word.

Unit tests are written for each function.
